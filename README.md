# SimPy-Simulation-Model-for-Railway-Platform-Ticket
Python code for simulating a model of platform ticket allotment and passenger distribution system, in a hypothetical railway station. 
The aim is to minimize the number of passengers on the platform in order to maintain social distancing.
### Requirements:
<li>SimPy</li>
<li>Random</li>
<li>Multiprocessing (optional)</li>

### Purpose:
<li>To give a feel of what simulations look like</li>
<li>Show the importance of smalll subprocesses in systems</li>
<li>Realize the need of randomness and statistical data to model these simulations</li>
<li>Demonstrate basic functions of SimPy</li>
